              They chose the British spelling of "neighbourhood" on the advice
              of their manager, in order to distinguish themselves from a band
              that already used the American word "neighborhood". In early 2012,
              the band released "Female Robbery" and "Sweater Weather". Our
              band's debut album, I Love You., was released on April 23, 2013
              and entered at number thirty-nine on the Billboard 200 chart.
              Rolling Stone had already released I Love You. on April 16 on
              their website, describing it as "atmospheric." In April 2014,
              THENBHD released "Honest", which is part of the soundtrack for The
              Amazing Spider-Man 2: Rise of Electro (2014). We then released a
              mixtape titled #000000 & #FFFFFF (the HTML color codes for black
              and white) in November 2014. That same year, they announced via
              twitter that "Sweater Weather" was certified platinum in the US.
